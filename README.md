# GitOps Workshop

Authors:
 - Brian Tomlinson <btomlins@redhat.com>
 - Skylar Scaling <sscaling@redhat.com>


## Description

A workshop designed to impart the core principals of GitOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/projects/argo-cd), [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/), and [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/).


## Prerequisites

### Tools

The following are requirements for both administrators setting up and facilitating the workshop, as well as attendees
participating in the workshop.

- [Ansible 2.8+](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible)
- [Git 2.26+](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


### Environment

For the best possible performance, it is recommended the workshop be conducted on a hosted (either bare-metal or via cloud provider)
Red Hat OpenShift 4.x or Kubernetes 1.16+ cluster. However, the following local solutions have been tested and verified to
work well enough for small audiences.

- [Code Ready Containers 1.13+](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.13/html/getting_started_guide/index)
- [Minishift 1.34+](https://www.okd.io/minishift/)
